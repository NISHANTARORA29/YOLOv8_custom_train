A robotic arm is a programmable mechanical device designed to perform tasks that require precision, strength, or repetitive motion. It typically has multiple joints that can rotate and pivot, allowing it to move in different directions. Robotic arms are used in manufacturing industries for welding, assembling, and material handling. They are also commonly found in medical fields, such as in robotic surgery, where they provide high precision. The arms are controlled through programming and can operate autonomously or be guided by a human operator.
