A lathe is a machine tool that primarily performs turning operations, where the workpiece is rotated, and a cutting tool is applied to it. Lathes are commonly used to machine cylindrical parts, such as shafts, rods, and bushings. They can be manually operated or CNC-controlled for more complex geometries. The cutting tool can be applied at different angles to produce various shapes, including tapering and threading.
