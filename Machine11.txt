A 3D printer is an advanced machine used to create three-dimensional objects layer by layer using materials such as plastic, resin, or metal. It operates by reading digital files (CAD models) and precisely depositing material according to the design. 3D printers are used in prototyping, product development, and even medical fields for creating custom prosthetics or implants. Its additive manufacturing process is versatile and can produce complex geometries that traditional machines cannot.
