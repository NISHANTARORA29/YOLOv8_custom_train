An Electric Discharge Machine is used to remove material from a conductive workpiece by generating electrical discharges between the tool and the workpiece. EDM is primarily used for machining hard materials that are difficult to machine with traditional methods, such as titanium or carbide. This machine is capable of producing complex shapes with tight tolerances. EDM machines are widely used in tool and die making, mold production, and aerospace industries.
