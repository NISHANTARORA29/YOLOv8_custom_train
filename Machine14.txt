A horizontal boring machine is used to bore large and precise holes in a workpiece. It consists of a horizontal spindle that holds the boring tool, which rotates while the workpiece remains stationary. This type of machine is commonly used in heavy industries such as shipbuilding, mining, and construction, where large and heavy workpieces need to be machined. It can also perform other functions like milling and drilling, making it a versatile tool in manufacturing.
