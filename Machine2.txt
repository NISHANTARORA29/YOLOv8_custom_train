Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) uses electrical discharges (sparks) to cut conductive materials. A thin wire acts as the electrode, and it erodes the material along the desired path. Wire EDM machines are used in industries requiring high precision, such as aerospace, medical devices, and tool and die making. This process is especially useful for cutting complex shapes and hard materials like titanium and hardened steel, where traditional machining might struggle.
