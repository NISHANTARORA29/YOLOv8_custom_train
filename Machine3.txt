A CNC router is a machine designed for cutting and engraving materials like wood, metal, plastic, and foam. It operates using computer-controlled movements, allowing for precise cuts and intricate designs. CNC routers are often used in woodworking, signage, and furniture manufacturing. These machines can produce highly detailed designs and are capable of repetitive, high-precision work, making them ideal for mass production.
