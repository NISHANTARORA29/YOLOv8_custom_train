This machine is used to manufacture plastic parts by injecting molten plastic into a mold. Injection molding machines are crucial for producing a wide range of everyday items, from household products to automotive parts. The machine operates by heating plastic pellets until they become molten, then forcing the material into a mold cavity. Once the plastic cools and solidifies, the mold is opened, and the part is ejected. This process is highly efficient for mass production.
