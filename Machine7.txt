 A laser cutting machine uses a high-powered laser beam to cut materials such as metal, wood, acrylic, and fabric. It is capable of making intricate and precise cuts. The machine focuses the laser beam on a specific area of the material, heating it to a point where it either melts or vaporizes, creating a clean cut. Laser cutting machines are used in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and signage for crafting detailed parts.
