A hydraulic press is used to compress materials using hydraulic pressure. This machine is widely used in metalworking, forming, and stamping operations. It consists of a hydraulic cylinder that generates force by applying fluid pressure. Hydraulic presses are utilized to shape, deform, or cut metals and are essential in manufacturing processes like forging, bending, and punching. They provide a consistent and controlled force, making them highly reliable for large-scale production.
